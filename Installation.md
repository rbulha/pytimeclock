## Instalation ##

### First time ###

Download the compressed file, uncompress in a folder like
  * c:\pytimeclock

We recommend to put the **TimeClock** into startup folder.

### Update ###

Uncompress the new version in a separated folder, then copy the entire folder content from this folder to you actual installation folder and overwrites all the files. This procedure will not change you personal marks.

Note: If you created a shortcut verify the execution path, should match the executable path.
